\begin{abstract}
Classical general relativity predicts that black holes contain a central singularity where spacetime curvature diverges. However, quantum effects may alter this picture. We propose a self-regulating black hole core model, in which Hawking-like radiation is generated locally as a function of spacetime curvature. This radiation counteracts gravitational collapse, leading to an equilibrium core of finite curvature. The model suggests that the black hole interior is a structured region rather than a classical singularity. We discuss the mathematical framework, implications for information retention, and directions for further study.
