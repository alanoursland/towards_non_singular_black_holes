Below is a focused list of key theoretical and methodological challenges outlined by the paper that must be addressed to move from heuristic modeling toward a rigorous, first-principles theory of non-singular black hole cores. By systematically resolving these issues, one can replace speculative or ad hoc equations with derivations firmly rooted in quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and self-consistent numerical analysis:

1. **Derive the Local Radiation Function From First Principles**  
   The paper posits a local Hawking-like emission rate Γₕ(r) tied to the Ricci scalar R(r), but it treats the dependence f(R) heuristically. To eliminate guesswork in equations like Γₕ(r) = f(R(r)) / M², it is necessary to:  
   • Formulate an explicit quantum field theory (QFT) treatment of particle creation in curved spacetime that yields a *local* emission rate (rather than the usual global horizon-based derivation).  
   • Justify how higher curvature “turns on” stronger radiation by identifying the precise operator(s) in QFT or quantum gravity that couple local curvature to particle production.  
   • Determine boundary conditions inside the horizon—traditionally not covered by standard Hawking radiation derivations—so that the function f(R) emerges naturally rather than being posited ad hoc.

2. **Incorporate Quantum Backreaction Into the Einstein Equations**  
   The framework relies on equilibrium conditions between gravitational collapse and radiation generation, but it treats backreaction (the effect of radiation on the spacetime metric) only schematically. A more complete approach requires:  
   • Defining an effective stress-energy tensor for the locally generated radiation.  
   • Modifying Einstein’s field equations to include this tensor, ensuring that both the radiation and the geometry evolve self-consistently.  
   • Resolving how negative-energy “partners” (conventionally invoked in Hawking radiation) contribute to the net mass-energy distribution inside the horizon.

3. **Establish a Self-Consistent Conservation Law and Balance Condition**  
   The paper sketches integrals like  
   ∫ Γₕ(r) dr = ∫ Φ_collapse(r) dr  
   but does not provide a rigorous derivation from a covariant continuity equation or a full set of Einstein-like field equations. To remove heuristic assumptions here, one must:  
   • Write down and solve the coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) for mass-energy flow, including both inward and outward fluxes under a modified gravity-plus-radiation framework.  
   • Ensure energy-momentum conservation is enforced locally (i.e., ∇ᵘTᵤᵥ = 0 for the combined matter + radiation system), rather than relying on a schematic balance of fluxes.

4. **Perform a Rigorous Stability Analysis (Linear and Nonlinear)**  
   To confirm that the proposed equilibrium core (at finite curvature) is more than a speculative fixed point, one needs to show that small and large perturbations do not destabilize it. Concretely, this entails:  
   • Linearizing the (quantum-corrected) field equations around the equilibrium solution to check for growing or decaying modes.  
   • Accounting for nonlinear effects by performing numerical simulations (e.g., solving PDEs on a grid), incorporating realistic boundary conditions at the event horizon and the central region.  
   • Demonstrating that curvature-dependent radiation *damps* rather than *exacerbates* perturbations near the core.

5. **Clarify the Late-Stage Evaporation and Remnant Formation**  
   The paper alludes to the possibility that the black hole may leave behind a stable, finite-size core or eventually evaporate completely. A purely heuristic approach cannot predict which outcome prevails. To eliminate uncertainty, future work must:  
   • Extend the quantum backreaction equations to smaller and smaller total mass M(t) and track how rc (the core radius) evolves over time.  
   • Assess whether the radiation rate f(R) saturates or shuts down as curvature approaches Planckian scales, potentially yielding a permanent remnant.  
   • Quantitatively couple the *external* Hawking process (the traditional horizon-based evaporation) to the *internal* local emission modeled in this framework.

6. **Resolve the Information Flow Mechanism**  
   If one goal is to demonstrate that quantum effects inside the horizon avert a singularity and address the black hole information paradox, the heuristic statements must give way to a fully quantum treatment of state evolution. This requires:  
   • Specifying how quantum states evolve within the black hole interior, not just the net energy balance.  
   • Demonstrating whether (and how) information escapes the black hole over its lifetime.  
   • Showing that the final state does not violate unitarity (or, conversely, identifying a suitable modification of standard quantum mechanics, if needed).

7. **Pin Down Observational Signatures (If Any)**  
   Although the paper largely presents a theoretical scenario, it hints at potential “echoes” or other gravitational wave signals from a structured interior. Making that more than speculation requires:  
   • Deriving wave equations for perturbations around the non-singular interior, showing how partial reflections or echoes might arise at the equilibrium core boundary.  
   • Estimating amplitudes, frequencies, or other phenomenological features that could be tested—albeit at extremely high precision—by future gravitational wave observatories or black hole imaging efforts.  
   • Distinguishing these signals from those predicted by competing alternatives (e.g., firewall scenarios, regular black holes of Bardeen/Hayward type, or loop quantum gravity bounces).

**In short, eliminating the heuristic nature of the paper’s equations requires a concerted effort to embed its central idea—local, curvature-dependent radiation—into a rigorous quantum-gravitational framework.** This includes deriving a physically justified emission function f(R), enforcing energy-momentum conservation through modified Einstein equations, rigorously analyzing stability, and detailing final-state dynamics and information flow. Only after these steps can one confirm whether the proposed self-regulating core genuinely supplants the classical singularity with a stable, finite-curvature interior.
