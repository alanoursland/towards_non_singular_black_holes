## **ðŸ“„ Paper Outline**
This will serve as the **structure** for the LaTeX document.

### **Title Page**
- **Title:** (Choose from the list)
- **Authors:** (We can leave this generic for now)
- **Abstract:** A concise summary of the theory, the core postulates, and its implications.

### **1. Introduction**
- Background on classical black hole theory and singularities.
- Why quantum effects matter inside the event horizon.
- Overview of the **Self-Regulating Core Hypothesis**.

### **2. Core Hypothesis**
- **Postulate 1: Local Curvature-Dependent Radiation**
  - Define local Hawking-like radiation as a function of curvature.
  - Discussion of why this is a heuristic extension of standard Hawking radiation.
- **Postulate 2: Radiation Collapse Balance**
  - Define equilibrium condition: \( \Gamma_H(\mathcal{R}_c) = \Phi_{\text{collapse}}(\mathcal{R}_c) \).
  - Explain how this counteracts singularity formation.
- **Postulate 3: Constant Curvature Core**
  - Define \( \mathcal{R}_c \) and its relation to energy density.
  - Discuss the possible Planck-scale limit.

### **3. Mathematical Framework**
- Expression of the mass flux equation incorporating radiation.
- Possible functional forms of \( f(\mathcal{R}) \) and the collapse rate \( \Phi_{\text{collapse}}(\mathcal{R}) \).
- Energy conservation arguments.

### **4. Stability and Open Questions**
- Is the equilibrium core dynamically stable?
- Can we derive \( f(\mathcal{R}) \) from quantum field theory?
- Does this model solve the information paradox?
- What happens in late-stage black hole evaporation?

### **5. Conclusions and Future Work**
- Summary of key results.
- Whatâ€™s needed to refine or test this theory?
- Possible observational or theoretical pathways forward.

### **Appendix (Optional)**
- Further discussion of potential modifications to Einsteinâ€™s equations.
- Comparison to alternative models (e.g., bounce models, fuzzballs).
